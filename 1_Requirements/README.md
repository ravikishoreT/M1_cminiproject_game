Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the paper-and-pencil games. This game requires two players in 3x3 grid with Player 1 acts as “O” and Player 2 acts as “X”, or vice versa. The objective of this game is to take place of three connecting grids in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way/fork.

This game was first introduced  at ancient time,  however there is no evidence  who invented it and which  year. Some people think  this game was  invented at  Ancient Egypt, and then Roman Empire called this game “Terni Lapili”. The grid drawing for the game had been found chalked all over the ancient city’s ruins.
